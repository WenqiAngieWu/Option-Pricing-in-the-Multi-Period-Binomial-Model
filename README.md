# Option-Pricing-in-the-Multi-Period-Binomial-Model
Build a multi-period binomial model whose parameters are calibrated to a Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion model.

Functions:
- European stock option pricing
- American stock option pricing & earliest time to exercise (it only matters for a put, since it's never optimal to early exercise a call)
- European single-stock futures Option pricing
- American single-stock futures Option pricing & earliest time to exercise
