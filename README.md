# Option-Pricing-in-the-Multi-Period-Binomial-Model
Build a multi-period binomial model whose parameters are calibrated to a Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion model.

Functions:
- European Stock Option pricing
- American Stock Option pricing & earliest time to exercise (it only matters for put option, since it's never optimal to early exercise call option)
- European Futures Option pricing
- American Futures Option pricing & earliest time to exercise
- Judge if put-call parity holds
